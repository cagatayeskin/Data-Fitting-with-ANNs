# Data Fitting with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

This is the tutorial on how to use notebooks of the paper "Data Fitting with Aritifical Neural Networks".

Article has five subsections in results section. For each of these, we have prepared different notebooks. Because all the notebooks have same kind of structure, we take the first one *Linear Data with Errors on Both Axes* as the main example here.

The first notebook *Linear Data with Errors on Both Axes* starts with an explanation of how we generate data throughout the paper. We begin by providing a method from literature to compare ANN results with. After showing the results of the method from the literature on an example test data, we move on to the part where we define ANN and train it (we also provided the option of downloading pre-trained ANN weights). In the rest of the notebook, we test ANN's predictions on different data sets and calculate some metrics to further examine the results. In the notebooks, we provide further information on each part.
