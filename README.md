# Data Fitting with Artificial Neural Networks

This is the tutorial for how to use notebooks of the paper "Data Fitting with Aritifical Neural Networks"

Article has five subsections in results section. For each of these, we have prepared different notebooks. Because all the notebooks have same kind of structure, we take the first one as the main example here.
