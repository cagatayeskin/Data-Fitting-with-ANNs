# Data Fitting with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

This is the tutorial on how to use notebooks of the paper "Data Fitting with Aritifical Neural Networks".

Article has five subsections in results section. For each of these, we have prepared different notebooks. Because all the notebooks have same kind of structure, we take the first one as the main example here.

First notebook *Linear Data with Errors on Both Axes* starts by explanation of how we generate data throught the paper. We start by providing a method from literature to compare ANN results later. After showing results of the method from literature on an example test data, we move on to the part where we define ANN and train it (we also provided the option of downloading pre-trained ANN weights). On the rest of the notebook we test ANN on different data sets and calculate some metrics to give more detailed examination of the results. In the notebooks we provide further information on each part.
